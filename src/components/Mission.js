                    <p className="text"> The European Union is currently falling behind in a number of key technologies,
                    such as quantum, energy, and software development - particularly the development of
                    artificial intelligence systems. Simultaneously, technological leadership has become a
                    central dimension of geopolitical power, impacting economic competition, national security,
                    and broader value-based notions of political order.</p> <br />

                    <p className="sub-headline">Our Obligation To Be At The Forefront Of Defence Technology</p><br />
                    <p className="text">Considering the current severe geopolitical disruption, this is particularly problematic
                    with regards to the defense sector, which is currently in a state of transformation,
                    from a hardware to a software dominated industry. Consequently, geopolitical players
                    are about to deploy powerful software applications for the sake of their own benefit.
                    While the European Union became used to falling back on allies in this regard, we cannot
                    expect their systems to be compliant with our values. Consequently, the European Union is
                    obligated to be at the forefront of technical innovation in this field and to open the
                    defense sector to innovation from entrepreneurial players.</p> <br />

                    marks a unique opportunity for me to return to the area of safety critical technology. 
                    Having prior experience in the defense industry and being educated in the ethical alignment 
                    of artificial intelligence systems enables me to work on developing software systems, 
                    which are compliant with our European values â€“ to build up a strong European Union which 
                    can serve as an antidote for the currently severe geopolitical disruptions.</p>
